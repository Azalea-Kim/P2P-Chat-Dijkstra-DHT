This repository presents a Java-based peer-to-peer (P2P) chat application with a user-friendly Swing interface. It supports direct messaging, broadcasting, and multicast messaging using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to dynamically select optimal peers based on simulated network conditions. The application features server-side user management functions such as listing connected clients, kicking users, and tracking user command history. Additionally, it integrates a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for decentralized, efficient user lookup and routing, enabling scalable peer-to-peer communication and reducing server dependency.
